## v4.2 Update — Claude Code 2.1.99-110 + Opus 4.7

> **Hokage line carries forward. Full Claude Code 2.1.99-2.1.110 + Opus 4.7 integration. Plugin manifest now matches the official `plugins-reference` schema.**

Anthropic shipped Opus 4.7 with literal-instruction-following semantics, plus Claude Code 2.1.105 added the `PreCompact` hook and the `monitors/monitors.json` manifest. v4.2 makes Harness fit those changes precisely:

| Area | Before (v4.1) | After (v4.2) |
|---|---|---|
| **Long-running workers** | Could be silently compacted mid-task | `PreCompact` hook blocks compaction while a worker is active or `Plans.md` is dirty |
| **Plugin validation** | `claude plugin validate` rejected `monitors`/`agents` blocks | Public-spec compliant: `monitors/monitors.json` + `agents/` auto-discovery |
| **Sync regression** | `harness sync` could silently strip declared blocks (4 prior incidents) | Two-layer guard: shell idempotency test + Go struct test for phantom fields |
| **Long sessions** | Default 5-minute prompt cache only | `bash scripts/enable-1h-cache.sh` opt-in to 1-hour TTL (CC v2.1.108) |
| **Reviewer/Advisor effort** | `medium` / `high` | `xhigh` (CC v2.1.111, Opus 4.7) — sharper review, with `high` fallback for other models |
| **Agent prompts** | Worked on Opus 4.6 implicit semantics | Re-tuned for Opus 4.7 literal instruction following — explicit thresholds, schemas, command names |
| **Guardrails (R01-R13)** | Conformed to CC 2.1.98 contract | Re-conformed to CC 2.1.110 (`PermissionRequest updatedInput`, `PreToolUse additionalContext`, Bash bypass closures) — 17 new regression tests |

**What you'll notice:**
- Long-running tasks no longer get cut off mid-flight by automatic compaction
- `claude plugin validate` runs clean on Harness for the first time since `monitors` was added
- `harness sync` stops mysteriously deleting your `monitors`/`agents` block
- Reviewer agent gives sharper feedback (xhigh effort) when running on Opus 4.7

Update with the usual flow:
```
/plugin update claude-code-harness
```

For detailed Before/After in Japanese, see `CHANGELOG.md` `[4.2.0]` entry.

## v4.0 "Hokage" — What's New

> **Go-native engine. 25x faster hooks. Zero Node.js dependency.**

Every tool call Claude makes passes through Harness hooks. In v3, each pass cost 40-60ms of bash + Node.js overhead — a subtle drag you feel across hundreds of calls per session. v4 replaces the entire stack with a single Go binary:

| | v3 (bash + Node.js) | v4 "Hokage" (Go) |
|---|---|---|
| **PreToolUse** | 40-60ms | **10ms** |
| **SessionStart** | 500-800ms | **10-30ms** |
| **PostToolUse** | 20-30ms | **10ms** |
| **Node.js** | Required (18+) | **Not needed** |

**What you'll notice:**
- The micro-pauses between tool calls disappear — Claude feels more responsive
- No more `npm install` or Node.js version issues on setup
- Session startup is instant (10-30ms vs almost a second)
- Optional [harness-mem](https://github.com/Chachamaru127/harness-mem) integration: sessions remember what you worked on last time

Just update the plugin — no configuration changes needed:
```
/plugin update claude-code-harness
```

---

## Hokage Core Extraction Status

Claude Code Harness remains a Claude-first product. "Hokage" currently names
the v4 Go-native runtime line, not a separate product claim.

Hokage Core extraction underway: the shared workflow contract is being separated
from host-specific adapters, while public support claims stay limited to the
gates that are already proven. No public `Hokage Harness` spin-off is claimed
until the Claude/Codex/OpenCode readiness gates pass.

Current gate status: [Hokage Spin-Off Readiness](docs/hokage-spin-off-readiness.md).

---

## Why Harness?

Claude Code is powerful. Harness turns that raw capability into a delivery loop that is easier to trust and harder to derail.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme-visuals-en/generated/why-harness-pillars.svg" alt="What changes with Claude Harness: shared plan, runtime guardrails, and rerunnable validation" width="860">
</p>

The 5 verb skills keep setup, plan, work, review, and release on one path. The Go-native guardrail engine protects execution with sub-10ms response, and validation can be rerun when you need proof.

## Compared With Popular Claude Code Harnesses

What matters here is not the theoretical ceiling of Claude Code. It is what becomes the **default operating model** once you install a harness — and what happens when you pair it with [harness-mem](https://github.com/Chachamaru127/harness-mem).

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme-visuals-en/generated/harness-feature-matrix.svg" alt="Comparison: Claude Harness + harness-mem vs Harness solo vs Superpowers vs cc-sdd — 10 capabilities compared" width="860">
</p>

With harness-mem, Claude Harness is the only setup where the default path is planned, guarded, reviewed, rerunnable, **and remembered across sessions**.

## Install in 30 Seconds

```bash
# Start Claude Code in your project
claude

# Add the marketplace & install
/plugin marketplace add Chachamaru127/claude-code-harness
/plugin install claude-code-harness@claude-code-harness-marketplace

# Initialize your project
/harness-setup
```

That's it. Start with `/harness-plan`.

### Language

Harness now ships with English as the default setup language. Japanese remains
fully supported as an explicit opt-in:

```yaml
i18n:
  language: ja
```

You can also start a temporary Japanese setup with
`CLAUDE_CODE_HARNESS_LANG=ja claude`. The Japanese README is
[README_ja.md](README_ja.md).

## 🪄 TL;DR: Verified Work All

**Don't want to read all this?** Just type:

```
/harness-work all
```

**One command runs the full loop after plan approval.** Plan → Parallel Implementation → Review → Commit.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme-visuals-en/work-all-flow.svg" alt="/work all pipeline" width="700">
</p>

> ⚠️ **Experimental workflow**: Once you approve the plan, Claude runs to completion. Validate the success/failure contract in [docs/evidence/work-all.md](docs/evidence/work-all.md) before depending on it in production.

## The 5 Verb Workflow

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme-visuals-en/generated/core-loop.svg" alt="Plan → Work → Review cycle" width="560">
</p>

### 0. Setup

```bash
/harness-setup
```

Bootstraps project files, rules, and command surfaces so the rest of the loop runs against the same conventions.

### 1. Plan

```bash
/harness-plan
```

> "I want a login form with email validation"

Harness creates `Plans.md` with clear acceptance criteria.

### 2. Work

```bash
/harness-work              # Auto-detect parallelism
/harness-work --parallel 5 # 5 workers simultaneously
```

Each worker implements, runs a preflight self-check, and waits for an independent review verdict before completion.

### Advisor Strategy

Harness is starting to adopt an advisor-style execution flow.
In plain terms, the executor keeps moving, and only asks for help when the decision is genuinely hard.

- High-risk tasks can trigger one preflight consultation
- Repeated failures can trigger a corrective consultation
- Plateau detection can trigger one last consultation before escalation
- Final approval still belongs to the reviewer, not the advisor

The weak-supervision layer adds evidence, not authority. It records cues such
as hollow test passes, missing reproduction, weak labels, and counterexamples
so the next Advisor prompt can avoid repeating a known failure pattern. The
Advisor contract remains `PLAN` / `CORRECTION` / `STOP`, and the Reviewer
still owns the final verdict.

The first rollout is in `harness-loop`, because long-running execution benefits most from "ask only when needed."
Details: [docs/advisor-strategy.md](docs/advisor-strategy.md)

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme-visuals-en/parallel-workers.svg" alt="Parallel workers" width="640">
</p>

### 3. Review

```bash
/harness-review
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme-visuals-en/review-perspectives.svg" alt="4-perspective review" width="640">
</p>

| Perspective | Focus |
|-------------|-------|
| Security | Vulnerabilities, injection, auth |
| Performance | Bottlenecks, memory, scaling |
| Quality | Patterns, naming, maintainability |
| Accessibility | WCAG compliance, screen readers |

### 4. Release

```bash
/harness-release
```

Packages the verified result into CHANGELOG, tag, and release handoff steps after implementation and review are complete.

## Safety First

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme-visuals-en/generated/safety-guardrails.svg" alt="Safety Protection System" width="640">
</p>

Harness v4 protects your codebase with a **Go-native guardrail engine** (`go/internal/guardrail/`) — 13 declarative rules (R01–R13), single binary with sub-10ms response:

| Rule | Protected | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| R01 | `sudo` commands | **Deny** |
| R02 | `.git/`, `.env`, secrets | **Deny** write |
| R03 | Shell writes to protected files | **Deny** |
| R04 | Writes outside project | **Ask** |
| R05 | `rm -rf` | **Ask** |
| R06 | `git push --force` | **Deny** |
| R07–R09 | Mode-specific and secret-read guards | Context-aware |
| R10 | `--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign` | **Deny** |
| R11 | `git reset --hard main/master` | **Deny** |
| R12 | Direct push to `main` / `master` | **Ask** by default (`ask` / `deny` / `allow`) |
| R13 | Protected file edits | **Warn** |
| Post | `it.skip`, assertion tampering | **Warning** |
| Perm | `git status`, `npm test` | **Auto-allow** |

Runtime differences between Claude Code hooks and Codex CLI gates are documented in [docs/hardening-parity.md](docs/hardening-parity.md).

## Advanced Features

### Breezing (Agent Teams)

Run entire task lists with autonomous agent teams:

```bash
/harness-work breezing all                    # Plan review + parallel implementation
/harness-work breezing --no-discuss all       # Skip plan review, go straight to coding
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme-visuals-en/breezing-agents.svg" alt="Breezing agent teams" width="640">
</p>

**Phase 0 (Planning Discussion)** runs by default — Planner analyzes task quality, Critic challenges the plan, then you approve before coding starts. 8+ tasks auto-split into manageable batches.

### Session Memory (harness-mem)

Harness treats [harness-mem](https://github.com/Chachamaru127/harness-mem) as a managed companion. On plugin `Setup:init`, Harness can set up harness-mem automatically for Claude Code and Codex; normal `SessionStart` hooks only use the existing wiring and never run setup.

- **Without harness-mem**: events are logged locally to `.claude/state/memory-bridge-events.jsonl` (no external dependency)
- **With harness-mem**: events are also sent to the memory server for cross-session search and retrieval
- **Weak-supervision events**: elicitation and review signals are appended to `.claude/state/elicitation/events.jsonl`; when harness-mem is healthy, they are forwarded as `elicitation_event` records without reading harness-mem's database

Useful controls:

```bash
harness mem status
harness mem setup
harness mem doctor --json
harness mem off
harness mem purge --confirm-purge
```

Auto setup is on by default and can be disabled with `CLAUDE_CODE_HARNESS_MEM_AUTO_SETUP=0`. Local memory stays in harness-mem's standard local paths (`~/.harness-mem/runtime/harness-mem` and `~/.harness-mem/harness-mem.db`). `purge` always requires explicit confirmation.

<details>
<summary><strong>Codex Engine</strong></summary>

Delegate implementation tasks to OpenAI Codex in parallel. Codex implements, self-reviews, and reports back.

```bash
/harness-work --codex implement these 5 API endpoints
/harness-review --codex  # 4 perspectives + Codex second opinion
```

> **Setup**: Install [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) and configure API key. Or run `./scripts/setup-codex.sh --user` to use Harness skills inside Codex CLI directly.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2-Agent Mode (with Cursor)</strong></summary>

Use Cursor as PM, Claude Code as implementer. Plans.md syncs between both.

```bash
/harness-release handoff  # Report to Cursor PM
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Content Generation (Slides & Video)</strong></summary>

```bash
/generate-slide   # 3 visual patterns, quality scoring, auto-export
/generate-video   # JSON Schema-driven pipeline with Remotion
```

> **Dependencies**: Slides need `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`. Video needs [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/) + ffmpeg.

</details>

## Why Harness vs Skill-Pack Only?

Skill packs can teach a prompt. Harness also enforces behavior at runtime.

- **Guardrail engine** blocks destructive writes, secret exposure, and force-push patterns on the actual execution path.
- **Hooks + review flow** keep quality checks close to the tools that edit your repo.
- **Validation scripts + evidence pack** give you a rerunnable way to confirm docs, packaging, and `/harness-work all` behavior.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Command not found | Run `/harness-setup` first |
| `harness-*` commands missing on Windows | Update or reinstall the plugin. Public command skills now ship as real directories, so `core.symlinks=false` no longer hides them. |
| Breezing falls back to Solo mode on Windows | Update to a build that includes `bin/harness-windows-amd64.exe`. Git Bash/MSYS/Cygwin now resolve that binary automatically; WSL2 users continue to use the Linux binary. |
| Plugin not loading | Clear cache: `rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-code-harness-marketplace/` and restart |
| Hooks not working | Run `bin/harness doctor` to diagnose (Go binary, no Node.js needed) |
| Stale v3 references after migration | Run `bin/harness doctor --residue` — auto-detects leftover references to deleted code |

For more help, [open an issue](https://github.com/Chachamaru127/claude-code-harness/issues).

## Uninstall

```bash
/plugin uninstall claude-code-harness
```

Project files (Plans.md, SSOT files) remain unchanged.
